## Fleeing For Their Lives: Reconsidering How Americans View Immigrants’ Reasons for Migrating

Politicians and media outlets often emphasize a distinction between migrants fleeing their home country for reasons linked to violence and migrants leaving their home country to pursue economic opportunity. This distinction is widely believed to play a crucial role in shaping natives’ immigration attitudes: natives are expected to be less welcoming towards immigrants who are perceived as seeking economic opportunity. Using two nationally representative survey experiments, I test the hypothesis that—when the threats and risks migrants face in their home country are equalized—natives will not penalize people who immigrate due to economic threat relative to people immigrating due to violence threat. After accounting for threat in the migrant’s home country, I find that natives’ special penalty associated with economic types of migration is erased. My results indicate that policymakers should reconsider existing immigration and refugee policies related to economic migration and poverty.
